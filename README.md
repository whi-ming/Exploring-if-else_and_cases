# assignment 2 comp 248 2022

In this project I explore how to use if else statements and cases, to custom different outputs depending on the user's input. 

The first projects consists of a list of numbered Covid symptoms. The user will choose which level of symptoms apply to them and the program will output the recommended action the user should take.

The second program requires the user to state the day of the week and time for the program to assign certain variables to a function Z. I don't really understand the purpose either...but it was a good excuse to explore cases and default options.
